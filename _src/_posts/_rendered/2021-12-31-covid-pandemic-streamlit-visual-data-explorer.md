[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is a [Python](https://www.python.org) library which turns scripts into shareable web apps without requiring any front-end code.

[Here](https://share.streamlit.io/padurean/covid-pandemic-streamlit) i've build a COVID-19 pandemic data visualizer with it. Data manipulation is done with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and charts are rendered using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io).

Source code is available [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/padurean/covid-pandemic-streamlit).
