            <h2>Food for thought</h2>
            <p>Very simply put, the idea behind backpressure is the ability to say "hey slow down!".
            Let's start with an example that has nothing to do with software:
            Imagine you own a factory that produces doughnuts (lucky you!) and just signed a contract
            with the largest grocery chain in the Northeast US.
            To increase output, you decided to overhaul your existing factory and open a new one.
            Late Monday evening you get a text "Emergency! Get to the factory now!".
            It turns out doughnuts were being produced 5% faster than they could be glazed and packaged.
            Needless to say, there was a big, tasty mess to clean up, one of the factories had to be
            temporarily shut down, and you couldn't fulfill your contract.
            <br/><br/>
            Misconfiguration can literally wreak havoc. To make matters worse, the glazer couldn't react
            by signalling "hey you, slow down!". Even if it could, it didn't have a way to hold on to
            some extra doughnuts or throw them into a plain donut bin while things slowed down.
            Being able to signal backpressure and handle temporary bursts is critical in building resilient systems.
            <br/><br/>
            Today we'll demonstrate backpressure in Akka Streams (note this is not an intro to Akka Streams itself).
